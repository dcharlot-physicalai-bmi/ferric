# ferric-signal

**Open sensor-language tokenization for physical signals.** Pure Rust. Turns a sensor stream into
discrete tokens that live in the same vocabulary as text, so a decoder can read a measurement and a
word through one embedding table — and ships a **determinism receipt** so anyone can check that a
given token stream came from a given signal.

```
ferric-signal tokenize vibration.csv --channels 2 --receipt run-a.kv --save-weights model.fsig
ferric-signal tokenize vibration.csv --channels 2 --weights model.fsig --receipt run-b.kv
ferric-signal verify   run-a.kv run-b.kv
ferric-signal cost     --window 1024
```

```
DIFFERENT SPEC. These runs were not asked the same question, so comparing
their tokens would mean nothing.
  differs: patch_len  16  vs  32
  differs: stride     16  vs  32
```

## Why

Reviewing the field in August 2026: the time-series **forecasting** foundation models are open but do
not speak language (Chronos, TimesFM, Moirai, Toto, Timer, Granite TTM). The models that do speak
language about sensors are either narrow — wearable IMU — or reachable only through an API. This
review located **no joules-per-token figure published for any of them.**

The tokenizer is the piece everything else depends on, and it is also by a wide margin the *small*
part: a discrete bottleneck over five dimensions with eight levels each spans 32,768 codes and needs
**no codebook at all**. So the component that makes the rest possible is the one that costs least to
open.

## What is here, and how far each part is verified

| Module | What it does | How it is checked |
|---|---|---|
| `fsq` | Finite scalar quantization | Bijection and round trip **exhaustive over all 32,768 codes** |
| `patch` | Patching + reversible per-channel normalization | Checked against its own inverse |
| `encoder` | Tower shape, parameter accounting, positions | Sizing checked against the published 9.5M; positions against the closed form |
| `tower` | Encoder and decoder forward passes | Allocated parameters equal the arithmetic; bit-exact across runs |
| `vocab` | Signal codes and text tokens in one id space | Every id in the combined space round trips |
| `cost` | Operations and bytes per token | Exact arithmetic, hand-checked |
| `receipt` | Recomputable claim about a token stream | Field-by-field digest sensitivity |
| `sha256` | Self-contained hash | Published test vectors, including the 1M-character one |
| `store` | Save and load weights | Save/load must yield **identical tokens**; every truncation point refused |
| `train` | Straight-through estimator | Gradient must behave as if rounding were the identity |
| `language` | Mixed text/signal sequences, causal LM | Encode/decode inverses; a position cannot see its future |

**95 tests.** Fourteen are mutation-controlled: each was verified to FAIL when the line it names is
broken, because a test that survives the mutation of the thing it names is decorative. Three real
bugs were found that way and none of them raised an error on their own — a quantizer that silently
halved its resolution, a stuck sensor that normalised to a full-amplitude signal made of rounding
dust, and a bottleneck whose latents grew until the code space collapsed from 32,768 to 27.

## Measured results, and what they are worth

Trained on **synthetic** physical processes — damped oscillation, thermal decay, PWM, chirp, noise on
drift — whose ground truth is known by construction.

| | |
|---|---|
| Transformer autoencoder, reconstruction | **25.5 dB SNR**, 0.28% of variance, 444x loss reduction |
| Signal to text, on trained examples | **5 of 5** processes named from their tokens alone |
| Signal to text, **held out** | **4 of 10 (40%)** against a 20% chance baseline |

**The third row is the one that matters.** Five examples over five classes is memorisable by a lookup
table, so the 5-of-5 proves nothing on its own. The held-out split runs the same processes with
different parameters — a faster decay, a wider duty cycle, a different chirp span — and 40% against
20% chance is the memorisation signature: the architecture learns the mapping, and has nothing to
generalise from. **That gap is what a real corpus would close.**

## What is NOT here

**There are no published weights for real sensors.** Everything above is synthetic, with labels the
generator wrote. Nothing has been compared against a reference implementation's outputs, because no
reference weights were located.

**The embedding table is frozen** during language training, because the autograd layer has no row
gather. A frozen embedding cannot learn that two signal codes mean similar things, which caps what a
small corpus can teach.

**Energy is not measured unless a meter exists.** `cargo run --example token_cost` reports the exact
operation count always, and prints `NOT MEASURED` when no hardware counter is readable rather than
printing a zero. A zero is indistinguishable from a very efficient run, which is how a great many
published efficiency claims come to be wrong.

## Two findings worth stating

**A per-token cost is not a constant.** Attention is quadratic, so the cost of a token is a property
of the *window* it sat in. The same token costs **5.4x more at 8192 patches than at 16**. Quoting
"X joules per token" without the window is not a tight figure missing context; it is an
underspecified one.

**At short windows this is bandwidth-bound**, at 8.1 FLOP per weight byte against the ~100–300 a
modern part needs to be compute-bound. On a sensor node the bill is reading the weights, not the
arithmetic — so quantize the weights rather than optimising the math.

## The receipt

Two digests. `spec_digest` covers everything that *determines* the tokens — signal, normalization
statistics, patching, encoder shape, weights, quantizer levels, vocabulary layout. `token_digest`
covers what came out. A mismatch is therefore diagnosable rather than merely alarming: same spec and
different tokens means the computation diverged; different spec means you compared two different
things, and that is reported first.

The platform is deliberately **outside** the spec digest. If it were inside, every machine would
digest differently and the comparison that matters — same question, same answer, different hardware
— could never be posed.

Receipts travel as flat key/value pairs, the shape [ferroscope](https://github.com/dcharlot-physicalai-bmi)
carries inside an MCAP recording. Interoperating on the format rather than by linking two build
graphs is deliberate.
